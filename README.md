# A-3.3V-3A-step-down-converter-powered-BY-USB-C
Without using a USB-C PD controller chip, handling communication over the USB cable, USB-C standard allows to get 5V up to 3A through a hardware availability detection.<br> Here I show a design developed on KiCad and made through JLCPCB, powering from a USB-PD source and 5V and 3.3 (through a step-down converter) up to 3A.
